## Intro

Tired of swiping game, here comes swipy which helps you to swipe profiles on bumble given some respective filters. if you are bored swiping right/left this might help you and have fun. while you are doing your work and being productive. swipy would do the job and your hands will be totally free :p

## How it works ?

Currently swipy is very specific as some common filter function is added but you can customize as per your own if you want. Basically it swipes 2000 profiles in a set once you would run the script at an interval of 4 seconds.
